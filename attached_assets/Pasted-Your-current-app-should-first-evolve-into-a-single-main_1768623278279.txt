Your current app should first evolve into a single main dashboard screen. On page load, calculate upcoming birthdays by comparing today’s date with saved birthday dates and automatically display three sections on the same page: today’s birthdays (if any), upcoming birthdays sorted by nearest date, and a small countdown label like “in 2 days” or “tomorrow” beside each name. Along with the countdown, dynamically calculate and display the age the person will turn this year. This will instantly make the app feel useful the moment it opens.

Next, add advanced reminder controls at the time of adding or editing a birthday. Along with name and date, include simple toggle or checkbox options that let the user choose when they want reminders, such as 1 day, 2 days, or 7 days before. Store these preferences in your database. On the backend, run a daily check (or on app load) that compares today’s date with each birthday and generates in-app notifications when the reminder condition matches. These notifications should appear inside the app and be stored so they persist even after refresh.

After that, introduce a calendar view without changing your existing list view. Add a calendar tab or button that opens a monthly calendar where birthdays are visually highlighted on their respective dates. Clicking a date should show a small popup or panel listing all birthdays on that day. This feature does not replace your list—it complements it and makes the app more interactive and app-like.

Then, implement dark and light mode properly. Add a toggle button that switches themes instantly with smooth transitions. Save the user’s theme preference in local storage or the database so it stays the same after reload. If no preference exists, automatically detect the system theme. This small feature greatly improves the premium feel of your app.

Finally, add birthday insights (stats) as a lightweight section or modal. From the existing birthday data, calculate how many birthdays fall in each month and identify the busiest month. Display this visually using a simple chart or summary text. This does not need to be complex—just enough to give users a sense of overview and make the app feel intelligent.
